		<p id="details" >Three concentric membranes, the meninges, envelop the brain and spinal cord. They provide support and protection for the delicate tissues they surround. The individual layers, in order from outside to inside, are the dura mater (pachymeninx), blockquotearachnoid mater and pia mater. The dura is an opaque, tough, fibrous coat which incompletely divides the cranial cavity into compartments and accommodates the dural venous sinuses. The arachnoid is much thinner than the dura and is mostly translucent. It surrounds the brain loosely, spanning over depressions and concavities. The pia mater is a transparent, microscopically thin, membrane which follows the contours of the brain and is closely adherent to its surface.</p>
